# Catpix_Minimagick_HD

Renders images in the terminal.

## Why not a fork but clone
This project is a "port" from [pazdera's catpix repo](https://github.com/pazdera/catpix).
The original project is based on RMagick while this one is based on MiniMagick. I was spending
time finding solutions with MiniMagick but could not find any hence I decided to port from the
original. Naming of the repo is prefixed with `catpix` and suffixed with `mini_magick` is for
honoring the original repo and for Github's search availability.

For more examples and APIs please check out [pazdera's catpix repo](https://github.com/pazdera/catpix). It should be very similar at this point except that the binary name is changed to `catpix_minimagick_hd`.
